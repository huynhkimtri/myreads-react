# MyReads Project Overview
MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The application is built using React and utilizes a backend API to persist user data.

## App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

### Features
* View books categorized into three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
* Search for books and add them to your shelves.
* Move books between shelves with ease.
* The application persists data even after refreshing the browser.
